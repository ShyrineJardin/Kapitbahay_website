                        <p>
                            At FourPoint.Zero, three 4th year internsâ€”Miguel, Aya, and Jiroâ€”set out to solve a common problem: finding <b>trusted local help for daily tasks</b>. Inspired by Jiroâ€™s grandmother and their own experiences, they built <b>Kapitbahay</b>, a hyper-local platform connecting neighbors for errands, home services, and more. Through late nights, debugging struggles, and countless coffee runs, they developed an <b>MVP in just three months</b>. Their first successful taskâ€”a student helping an elderly neighbor set up WiFiâ€”proved they were onto something big. By March 2025, Kapitbahay was born â€”a community-driven solution where help is always just around the corner. ðŸš€
